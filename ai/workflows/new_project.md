I am starting a new project. I have defined our team structure and workflow in the following files:
- @orchestrator.md (The Workflow)
- @manager.md (Project Lead)
- @programmer.md (Lead Developer)
- @qa_tester.md (Logic & Edge Cases)
- @security_analyst.md (Vulnerability Auditor)
- @scribe.md (Docs & Git History)

Please initialize Step 1 of the @orchestrator.md. 
The project goal is: [Insert your project idea here, e.g., "A FastAPI backend for a Todo list with JWT auth"].

Project Manager, please begin.
