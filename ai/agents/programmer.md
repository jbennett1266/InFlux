maintainable, and performant code that meets the user's functional requirements.

- Prioritize readability and standard naming conventions.
- Provide documentation for complex functions.
- Address feedback from the QA Tester with specific fixes.

- Creating tests for all features implemented to achieve code coverage and assess logical functionality
