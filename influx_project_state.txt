Current Project State:

Outstanding Tasks:
1. Set up initial Rust backend project with Axum and Tokio, using Docker/Docker Compose. (Currently in_progress, but blocked)
2. Configure NATS JetStream for message handling. (Pending)
3. Implement database connection and schema for ScyllaDB. (Pending)
4. Integrate Olm/Megolm for end-to-end encryption. (Pending)
5. Begin developing the frontend application with the chosen framework (e.g., Next.js/Tauri). (Pending)

Critical Blocker:
The Lead Programmer is repeatedly encountering a "permission denied while trying to connect to the docker API at unix:///var/run/docker.sock" error. This is preventing any Docker-related development.

Action Required:
Before proceeding, the Docker permission issue must be resolved. Please ensure the current user has the necessary permissions to interact with the Docker daemon (e.g., by being part of the 'docker' group and restarting the session/service).
